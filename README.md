# Task Manager

Solution for the [task-tracker](https://roadmap.sh/projects/task-tracker) challenge from [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/).

A simple **Task Manager** command-line application built with Node.js that allows users to list, add, update, and delete tasks. The application stores tasks in a `tasks.json` file, and each task contains details like an ID, description, status, and timestamps for when it was created and last updated.

## Features
- **List tasks**: View all tasks, tasks that are done, tasks not done, or tasks that are in progress.
- **Add tasks**: Add a new task with a description and status.
- **Update tasks**: Modify the description or status of existing tasks.
- **Delete tasks**: Remove a task from the list.
- **Persist tasks**: Tasks are stored in a JSON file (`tasks.json`).

## Dependencies
This project relies on the following Node.js libraries:
- [**inquirer**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) for user input prompts.
- [**chalk**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chalk) for colorful console output.
- [**nanospinner**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nanospinner) for loading spinners.
- [**chalk-animation**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chalk-animation) for animated console output.
- [**figlet**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/figlet) for ASCII text rendering.
- [**gradient-string**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gradient-string) for gradient text.

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js** (v12.0.0 or higher)
- **npm** or **yarn** for installing dependencies
